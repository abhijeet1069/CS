# Factory Method

Use a factory method when object creation is complex, dynamic, or repeated across many places.
Avoid it when your use case is simple and static.

```java

//Without factory method : Note to use the car car.drive(), it has a big
//creation process, so here factory method makes sense

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Config config = ConfigLoader.load("car-config.yaml");
        GpsService gpsService = new GpsService();
        ExternalRegistryService registry = new ExternalRegistryService();

        Car car = new Car(config.getFuelType(), config.getBrand());
        car.installGps(gpsService);
        registry.register(car);
        car.initialize();

        car.drive();
    }
}



```
