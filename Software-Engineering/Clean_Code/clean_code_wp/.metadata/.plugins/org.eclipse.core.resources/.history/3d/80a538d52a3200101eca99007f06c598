# Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used when you need to construct a complex object step by step and you want to avoid having a constructor with too many parameters.

âœ… When to use Builder Pattern
1. Object has many optional fields.
2. You want to make the object immutable.
3. You want readable and maintainable code (fluent API).

```java



    

 


public class BuilderDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Computer customPC = new Computer.Builder()
                                .setCPU("AMD Ryzen 7")
                                .setRAM(16)
                                .setGraphicsCard(true)
                                .build();

        Computer defaultPC = new Computer.Builder()
                                .build();

        System.out.println("Custom PC: " + customPC);
        System.out.println("Default PC: " + defaultPC);
    }
}
