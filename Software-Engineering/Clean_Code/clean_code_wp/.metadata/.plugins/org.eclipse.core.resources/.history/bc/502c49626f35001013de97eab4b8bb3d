# Singleton pattern

The Singleton Design Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures only one instance of a class exists in the application and provides a global point of access to it.

## Basic Singleton

This singleton has a thread safety problem.

```java
public class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;

    private Singleton() {
        // private constructor
    }

    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}

```
