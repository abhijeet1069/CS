# Data Structures

Putting the right data structure into a slow program can work the same wonders as transplanting fresh parts into a sick
patient.But it is better to be born with a good heart than have to wait for a replacement.
    The maximum benefit from proper data structures results from designing your program around them in the first place.

## Arrays

Arrays are structures of fixed-size data records such that each element can be efficiently
located by its index or (equivalently) address.
