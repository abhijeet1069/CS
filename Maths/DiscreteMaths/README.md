# Discrete Maths

## Concepts in DSA come directly from discrete math

- Recursion → Induction
- Graph algorithms → Graph theory
- Hashing → Set theory & functions
- Trees → Recurrence, combinatorics
- DP → Relations, state transitions

Instead of viewing discrete math as a waiting period, think of it as:

“Sharpening the axe before cutting the tree.”

When you do move to algorithms, you’ll:
	•	Solve harder problems faster
	•	Understand the why behind tricks
	•	Gain confidence in proofs and correctness
