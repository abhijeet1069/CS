    "# Elementary number theory and methods of proof\n",
    "\n",
    "\"... it is demanded for proof that every doubt becomes impossible.\" - Charles Friedrich Gauss\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most important reasons for requiring proof in mathematics is that writing a proof forces us to become aware\n",
    "of weaknesses in our arguments and in the unconscious assumptions we have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Definitions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Even Odd\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer n is even iff n equals twice some integer. An integer n is odd iff n equals twice some integer plus 1.\n",
    "    n is even <=> n = 2k for some integer k\n",
    "    n is odd  <=> n = 2k+1 for some integer k\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prime\n",
    "\n",
    "n is prime <=> ∀ positive integers r and s, if n = rs\n",
    "                then either r=1 and s=n or r=n and s=1\n",
    "n is composite <=> ∃ positive integers r and s, if n = rs\n",
    "                and 1 < r < n and 1 < s < n\n",
    "\n",
    "### Perfect Square\n",
    "\n",
    "An integer n is called a perfect square iff, n = k^2 for some integer k\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rational numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "A real number r is rational iff it can be expressed as a quotient of 2 integers with a nonzero denominator. A real\n",
    "number that is not rational is irrational.\n",
    "More formally,\n",
    "    r is rational <=> ∃ integers a and b such that r = a/b and b ≠ 0\n",
    "\n",
    "Question we scratched our heads when we were kids.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Is } 0.121212\\ldots \\text{ a rational number?} \\\\\n",
    "Solution: \\\\\n",
    "x = 0.1212.... \\\\\n",
    "\\text{Then } 100x = 12.121212\\ldots \\\\\n",
    "100x - x = 12.1212\\ldots - 0.1212\\ldots \\\\\n",
    "99x = 12 \\\\\n",
    "x = \\frac{12}{99}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root of polynomial\n",
    "\n",
    "A number c is called a root of a polynomial p(x) iff p(c) = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "## Proving existential generalization (Existential Generalization)\n",
    "\n",
    "∃x ∈ D such that Q(x) is true iff,\n",
    "    Q(x) is true for at least one x in D\n",
    "\n",
    "## Disproving Universal statments by Counterexample\n",
    "\n",
    "To disprove a statement ∀x in D, if P(x) then Q(x),\n",
    "prove ∃x ∈ D such that P(x) and not Q(x) and this x is called a counter example\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalizing from the Generic particular\n",
    "\n",
    "To show that every element of a set satisfies a certain property, suppose x is a particular but arbitrarily chosen\n",
    "element of the set, and show that x satisfies the property.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Method of Direct Proof\n",
    "\n",
    "- Express the statement to be proved in the form \"For every x ∈ D, if P(x) then Q(x)\"\n",
    "- Start the proof by supposing x is particular but arbitrarily chosen element of D for which the hypothesis\n",
    "    P(x) is true\n",
    "- Show that the conclusion Q(x) is true using definitions, previously established results and the rules for\n",
    "    logical inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Existential Instantiation\n",
    "\n",
    "If the existence of a certain kind of object is assumed or has been deduced, then it can be given a name, as long as\n",
    "that name is not currently being used to refer something else in the same discussion.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Zero Product Property\n",
    "\n",
    "If neither two real number is 0, then their product is also not zero."
